# Running DeepReg Remotely (on the Cluster)

This tutorial gives an example of how to run DeepReg remotely (e.g. on a cluster). Our
example is specific to the UCL cluster, which has operating system CentOS 7 (similar to
Ubuntu), with job scheduler Sun Grid Engine (SGE). More information on the specific
configuration at UCL is available [here](https://hpc.cs.ucl.ac.uk/job-submission/).

## Installing the Environment

Install the environment in the cluster, as described [here](../../../README.md). In the
case you do not have root access (as the case of the UCL cluster), you might need to use
pip -u option to install the requirements.txt file.

## Example Script

Below is the submission script for running quick start example
[here](../getting_started/quick_start.md). Change `<DeepReg_dir>` in the script to the
remote DeepReg repo location and save the below code in a `<your_name>.qsub`. Submit the
job with `qsub <your_name>.qsub` and check the status of the job with `qstat`, the saved
stdout and stderr is in `<DeepReg_dir>/logs/`.

```
#!/bin/bash
#$ -S /bin/bash   # bash for job
#$ -l gpu=true   # use gpu
#$ -l tmem=10G   # virtual mem used
#$ -l h_rt=36:0:0   # max job runtime hour:min:sec
#$ -R y
#$ -N DeepReg_tst   # job name
#$ -wd <DeepReg_dir>/logs   # output, error log dir

cd <DeepReg_dir>
conda activate deepreg   # activate conda env
export PATH=/share/apps/cuda-10.1/bin:/share/apps/gcc-8.3/bin:$PATH   # path for cuda, gcc
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/share/apps/cuda-10.1/lib64:/share/apps/gcc-8.3/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH   # path for cuda, gcc

deepreg_train \
--gpu "0" \
--config_path config/unpaired_labeled_ddf.yaml \
--log_dir test
```

## Contact and Version

Please contact stefano.blumberg.17@ucl.ac.uk, for information about the cluster. The
information here is likely to change as UCL updates the software on the cluster.
